# Effect dual

In the context of APIs, "dual" refers to a function that supports both the "data-first" and "data-last" variants. It means that the API can be used interchangeably with either style, depending on the developer's preference.

One example of a dual API is the andThen function of the Effect data type.

In the "data-first" variant, the effect is passed as the first argument to andThen:

```ts
import { Effect } from 'effect';
Effect.andThen(Effect.succeed(1), (n) => n + 1);
```
