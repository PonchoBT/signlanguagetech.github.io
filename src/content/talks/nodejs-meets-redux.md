title: 'Node.js Meets Redux'
description: "Node.js and Redux! Get ready for a wild ride through the live coding of JavaScript as we delve into the corners of Node.js and Redux. Don't worry, this isn't your typical tech talk! We keep things fun, friendly, and a little bit odd. Perfect for code enthusiasts who want to learn, laugh, and level up their web development skills. Buckle up, it's going to be a weirdly wonderful journey! Thanks for the support: @DeafTech"
